# StatTools Project Brief

## Project Overview
StatTools is a Python library for creating and processing long-term dependent datasets, with a focus on statistical analysis tools for fluctuation analysis, time series generation, and signal processing.

## Core Purpose
The library provides tools for:
- Generating synthetic datasets with specified statistical properties (Hurst exponent, long-term dependencies)
- Performing fluctuation analysis (DFA, DPCCA, FA)
- Filtering and processing time series data
- Research and analysis of complex systems exhibiting long-range correlations

## Key Components
1. **Generators**: Create synthetic signals with controlled statistical properties
2. **Analysis Tools**: Perform detrended fluctuation analysis and related methods
3. **Filters**: Process and transform datasets
4. **Research Utilities**: Support scientific research in complex systems

## Target Users
- Researchers in physics, biology, finance, and other fields studying complex systems
- Data scientists working with time series analysis
- Academics conducting research on long-term dependencies and fractal processes

## Success Criteria
- Accurate implementation of statistical algorithms
- Efficient performance for large datasets
- Well-documented API with examples
- Active maintenance and community contributions
- Published research using the library

## Scope Boundaries
- Focus on statistical analysis of long-term dependent processes
- Support for common fluctuation analysis methods
- Python-based implementation with C++ extensions for performance
- Research-oriented rather than production data processing
